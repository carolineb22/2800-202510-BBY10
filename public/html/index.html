                <h2>THE PROJECT</h2>
                <p>Our Tomorrow is a web game created by team BBY10 for our projects
                    course at school. The game is an incremental game where the player
                    must work together with other players to achieve a common goal. The
                    game is designed to be simple and easy to play, with a focus on
                    collaboration and teamwork. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript, and is designed to be played in a web browser. The game
                    is currently in development, and we are working hard to make it the
                    best it can be. We are excited to share our progress with you, so
                    check back soon for updates!</p>
