## How to run with node
Update this section as you work and add dependencies.
Make sure you update the package requirements in the code block below.
Don't make us have to check the dependencies manually.

Code blocks are run in console in the root of the project directory.

### Initialize locally (do this once)
```js
npm i
npm i express
```

### Run using Nodemon
```js
npm i
nodemon index.js
```
