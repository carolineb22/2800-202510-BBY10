## File Structure
Put all front-end files into the `/public` directory.
(Raw HTML files, CSS, images, fonts, etc.)
Put these files into their respective folders; E.g. `.html` files in `/public/html`, `.css` files in `/public/styles`.
If no directory exists, create one with an appropriate name.

## How to run with node
Update this section as you work and add dependencies.
Make sure you update the package requirements in the code block below.
Don't make us have to check the dependencies manually.

Code blocks are run in console in the root of the project directory.

### Initialize locally (do this once)
```js
npm i
npm i express
```

### Run using Nodemon
```js
npm i
nodemon index.js
```
